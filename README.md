## 🍯 About

**`miel` is a modular honeypot software that adapts to attackers interactions.**

- Expose voluntarily vulnerable services to analyze attackers behavior.
- Let miel adapt to the attacker's request to serve him with the right service.
- Simply add new services with configuration files.
- Link a database to store paquet trace, shell interactions, metadata, etc.
- Ships with pre-filled ssh and http configuration files.

## Why?

Honeypots can be used in two situations. First to deceive attackers and avoid
real infrastructure to be compromised. Secondly to intercept and retain
attacker's connections in a MiTM way in order to analyze and collect
interactions, IoC or payloads.

Today's available solutions allow to either masquerade one service at a time or
deploy multiple honeypots, each one masquerading one service, upon completing a
full scan of the real infrastructure to detect which systems are present and
need to be secured.

**_miel_** seeks to deliver a chameleon research honeypot. One capable of
serving the corresponding service that matches the attacker's expectations,
providing richer interaction data for analysis.

## How?

- Rust🦀 guarantees us memory safety without performance cost
- [tokio🗼](https://tokio.rs/) asynchronous runtime performs efficient async.
  I/O, supports large amount of protocols and has built-in security features
  such as robust timeout handling preventing resource exhaustion.
- [systemd-nspawn](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-nspawn) handles the
  containerization of the services.
